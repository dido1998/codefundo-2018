# codefundo-2018
The official repo of team flow.

We will focus on floods currently, we may add support for other disasters-

Our idea will be divided into the following parts-
- Our map will be for two sets of users- NGOs running relief operations and people stuck in flood 
- Extracting real-time maps of roads from an online API.
- Comparing pre-flood and post-flood images to detect flooded road by creating a road-segmentation network.
- NGOs will have access to the coordinates and the situation of people stuck in distress which will be extracted from twitter using the location API and sentiment analysis techniques.  
-The people stuck in floods can get updates about relief operations and send distress calls which include their location and situation.

We plan to implement a chatbot interface to make the app more user friendly.
